Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Orzo (closest to şehriye I could find), 1 cup
        - Long Grain White Rice, 1 cup
        - Butter, 50g (Good Wedge)
        - Chicken Stock, 550ml (just over 2 cups)

Method:
    - Heat the chicken stock, either in a separate saucepan or in the microwave if you must. If making from stock cube, make at the last minute with boiling water.
    - Add the butter to a large saucepan, and place over a medium heat.
    - Fry the orzo in the butter, stirring gently for a few minutes until it is well coloured. You're looking for a good golden colour but make sure it doesn't burn.
    - When nearly coloured, add the rice and fry gently for another minute.
    - Pour in the chicken stock, stir gently and place a well fitting lid onto the pan. Reduce the heat to low.
    - Keep the lid on and the heat low for around 15 minutes. Don't be tempted to lift the lid, just leave it.
    - When 15 minutes is up, remove from the heat (don't touch that lid!) and let rest for another 15 minutes.
    - Remove the lid, fluff up with a fork and serve.
