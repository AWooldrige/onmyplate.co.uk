Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Salmon Fillet, 2 small fillets (mine were 110 g each)
        - Filo Pastry, 8 sheets
        - Lemon, 2 wedges
        - Melted Butter, 50 g
    Couscous:
        - Couscous, 140 g
        - Green Bell Pepper, 40 g (1/2 small pepper), small dice
        - Red Bell Pepper, 40 g (1/2 small pepper), small dice
        - Yellow Onion, 100 g (1 medium onion), small dice
        - Fresh Tomatoes, 150 g (2 medium), small dice
        - Garlic, 2 large cloves, small dice
        - Curled Parsley, small handful, roughly chopped
        - Fish Stock, 250 ml
        - Salt, 1/2 tsp, depending on saltiness of stock
        - Smoked Paprika, 1/4 tsp
        - Ground Black Pepper, 1 tsp

Method:
- Prepare the couscous:
    - Place a saucepan on a medium heat.
    - Fry the onion, red pepper, green pepper, garlic and olive oil in the saucepan for 10 minutes until the onions start to soften and colour.
    - Add the tomato, smoked paprika, black pepper. Continue frying for 5 minutes.
    - Pour in the fish stock and bring to the boil. Test for salt levels and adjust if needed. This will depend on your stock, if using a bought stock then it's likely to be quite salty already.
    - Stir in the couscous and parsley, place a lid on the pan and remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes whilst preparing the pastry.
- Prepare each parcel. The photo below can be used as a guide:
    - For each parcel, layer 4 sheets of filo. Lightly brush each layer with melted butter before laying the next sheet on top.
    - You should now have 2 stacks of filo, each with 4 sheets, one stack for each parcel.
    - Divide the couscous evenly between the two stacks. You might not need to use all the couscous, it depends on the size of the filo sheets. Form it into a rough cuboid for the salmon to sit on.
    - Place a salmon fillet on top of each couscous pile. Then lay a lemon wedge on top of the salmon.
    - Bring up the sides of the filo and form a rough parcel. Brush the narrowest part of the parcel with any remaining melted butter.
- Transfer the parcels to individual cooking dishes that can support the parcel as it cooks. Brush the dishes lightly with butter also.
- Place in a preheated 180 c oven for about 30 minutes until the filo is golden but not burnt.
