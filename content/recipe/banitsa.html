Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Fresh Filo Pastry, 8 sheets (200 g)
        - Feta Cheese, 250 g
        - Eggs, 4 medium
        - Olive Oil, 3 tbsp
        - Butter, 60 g, melted

Method:
    - Place the oven on to preheat at 190c and prepare the mixture in the mean time:
        - In a large bowl whisk the eggs well with the olive oil.
        - Taste a piece of the feta for saltiness. If it is not overly salty, add a pinch of salt to the eggs.
        - Crumble the feta into the eggs, leaving some good marble sized lumbs.
    - Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then remove from the heat.
    - Brush a circular dish (21cm diameter) liberally with melted butter.
    - Repeat the following to create 4 rolls and assemble the dish to match the images shown:
        - Take 2 sheets of filo at a time, lay flat on a large surface and brush with melted butter.
        - Spread roughly a quarter of the mix across the filo sheets, it doesn't need to be perfect. See the images in the recipe for an example.
        - Roll the sheet up with the mix to form like a savoury swiss roll.
        - Very carefully curve the roll and flush it to the inside rim of the dish. It'll likely only go halfway around.
        - Continue this to fill the dish up as shown in the images.
    - Brush the rest of the melted butter over the top of the dish.
    - Put into the oven for roughly half an hour. Do this partly by eye, you're looking for a golden crispy top. I let mine go to about 95c in the centre.
    - When done, leave to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Tips:
    - There are loads of different fillings for Banitsa. So I knew what the base tastes like, this recipe is for a plain egg and cheese filling. Variations are:
        - Sweet varieties with apple and cinnamon or pumpkin and sugar.
        - Other meat-free varieties such as sauteed spinach within the egg mix or cooked onions within the egg mix.
        - Carnivore variety with minced beef and onions.

<p>Introduced to me by <a href="http://yavkata.co.uk/about" target="_blank">Yavor Atanasov</a> on his birthday, Banitsa is usually eaten on special occasions such as Christmas and New Year's Eve. Not only did I guess the ingredients wrong, but my pronunciation was appalling. I pronounced it as "Ban-eat-sar" however it should be "Bar-knit-sa".</p>
