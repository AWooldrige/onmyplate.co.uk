Summary: Techniques vary, ingredients vary, but the taste is always superb. Saffron is a must, and isn't overly expensive as a little goes a long way.

Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Chicken Breast, 1 breast, medium cubes
        - Chorizo, large piece (150g), sliced
        - King Prawns, 15
        - Red Bell Pepper, 1 whole, medium dice
        - White Onion, 1 large, finely chopped
        - Garlic, 4 large cloves (to taste), finely sliced
        - Fresh Tomatoes, 4 medium, finely chopped
        - Frozen Peas, good handful
        - Short grain Rice (Calasparra is good), 300 g
        - Olive Oil, 4 tbsp
        - Saffron, small pinch (0.25g)
        - Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp
        - Lemon, 1 whole, cut into wedges
        - Fish (or Chicken) Stock, 1 l
        - Yellow Food Colouring, 2 drops
        - Flat leaf Parsley, small bunch, finely chopped

Method:
    - Add olive oil to a large <a href="http://paellaprofessor.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/pan-paellera-or-paella.html">paellera</a> (or frying pan in my case). Place over a medium heat until the oil is hot.
    - Add the chopped onion, smoked paprika and chorizo to the oil. Fry for 5 minutes until the onions are golden and softened.
    - Tomatoes next, add to the pan and continue frying for another 5 minutes.
    - Add the rice, red pepper and garlic to the pan, fry for 3 minutes.
    - Add the chicken stock, chicken breast, saffron, peas and food colouring to the pan, reducing the heat to low. 
    - Simmer for 30 minutes:
        - Purists would say never stir, but I like to very gently move the rice around once during cooking, about halfway.
        - Add more hot water near the end if things look like they're drying out.
        - Remember that this dish shouldn't have any water, and should have a crunchy base (known as a <a href="http://paellaprofessor.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/la-soccarat.html">soccarat</a>)
    - Either add the king prawns about 7 minutes before the end, or fry them separately in some butter and add at the end.
    - When all the liquid is absorbed, arrange the lemon wedges on the paella and sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Let sit for 5 minutes covered with foil, then serve.
