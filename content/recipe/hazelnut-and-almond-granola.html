Summary: Gently toasted, with just the right amount of sweetness. I couldn't find a granola recipe that looked good so I came up with this (rather moreish) one.

Cook Time: PT45M - 45 mintes
Prep Time: PT10M - 10 minutes
Yield: about 2 litres
Cuisine: American
Category: Breakfast
Legacy WP ID: 502

Ingredients:
    Toasting:
        - Thick Rolled Oats, 300 g
        - Whole Blanched Hazelnuts, 100 g
        - Whole Blanched Almonds, 100 g
        - Sunflower Seeds, 100 g
        - Sesame Seeds, 100 g
        - Maple Syrup, 90 ml
        - Clear Honey, 50 ml
        - Dark Brown Muscovado Sugar, 2 tbsp (35 g)
        - Sunflower Oil, 3 tbsp
        - Vanilla Extract, 1 tsp
        - Sea Salt, 1 tsp, optional
    Dried Fruit:
        - Sultanas, 70 g
        - Currants, 70 g
        - Raisins, 70 g
        - Dried Cranberries, 70 g

Method:
    - Preheat the oven to 150 c (fan assisted).
    - In a large bowl carefully mix all of the toasting ingredients. It's a stubborn mixture so use strong kitchen utensils!
    - Spread the mixture over a large baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Spread it reasonably thin so there's a large surface area for browning. Either use one large tray or two medium sized trays.
    - Bake for about 45 mins. Every 10 minutes, give the mixture a good stir and check how toasted it is. Really use your eye to determine when the granola is fully baked, because every oven is different.
    - Remove from the oven and leave to completely cool.
    - Stir through the dried fruits then transfer to an airtight container(s) for storage. This will keep fresh for a few weeks, not that you'll be able to leave it that long!
