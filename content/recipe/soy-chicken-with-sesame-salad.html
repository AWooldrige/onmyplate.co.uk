Ingredients:
    Soy Chicken Marinade:
        - Chicken Breast, 2
        - Soy Sauce, 6 tbsp
        - Liquid Smoke, 2 tsp, highly dependant on brand
        - White Sugar, 2 tbsp
        - Salt, 1/2 tsp
    Sesame Salad Dressing:
        - Sesame Seeds, 2 tbsp
        - Toasted Sesame Oil, 2 tsp
        - Mayonnaise, 2 tbsp
        - Rice Wine Vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp
        - Honey, 1 tsp
        - Salt, 1/8 tsp
    Salad:
        - Mangetout, small punnet
        - Cucumber, 1 whole, sliced lengthways
        - Tomatoes, 5, half moon sliced
        - Red Pepper, 2, long slices

Method:
    - The night before, create the soy sauce marinade by:
        - Place the soy sauce and sugar in a small saucepan.
        - Over a gentle heat, slowly reduce the mix, stirring regularly until it reaches a thick liquid like the consistency of double cream.
        - Cool completely, it will be then the thickness of golden syrup.
        - Rub the chicken with the concentrate, make sure they're well coated.
        - Marinate overnight in the fridge.
    - When ready to cook, first make the Sesame Salad Dressing:
        - Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan until turned a light golden colour. Make sure they don't burn. Set aside into a bowl and let cool.
        - Place the sesame seeds into a pestle and mortar, crush to make sure they're all crushed.
        - Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
    - Put a grill plate (or frying pan, or BBQ) onto a medium heat whilst you prepare the salad.
    - Place the chicken onto the griddle plate, turn occasionally and use a digital temperature probe to cook until perfect (70c).
    - Just before removing the chicken from the pan, dash some more liquid smoke and plenty of lime juice over the chicken, then remove from the heat.
    - Prepare the salad, then toss through with the dressing.
    - Serve with plenty of chopped fresh coriander over the top.

Tips:
    - The chicken really should be marinated at least 12 hours in advance, so get that prep done!
