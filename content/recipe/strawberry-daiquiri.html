Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Strawberries, 12
        - White Rum, 2 measures
        - Creme De Cassis, 2 measures
        - Lime Juice, 1 measure
        - White Sugar (or gomme syrup), 1 tsp
        - Ice Cubes, 2 Glasses Full

Method:
    - Before anything, use the martini glass you will serve in to measure the amount of ice needed. Place this ice into a blender.
    - Fill the martini glass back up with more ice, top up with cold water, and allow this to cool the glass whilst preparing the drink.
    - Prepare strawberries by washing and cutting the tops off 10, leaving two with their stalks on for decoration after.
    - Place the rest of the ingredients in the blender, blend till smooth.
    - At this point, taste test for the balance between the sugar and the lime juice, adding more of either to suit your taste.
    - Pour the ice and water out of the glass, then pour in the drink from the blender.
    - Run the knife halfway into the strawberries, then place on the side of the glasses.
