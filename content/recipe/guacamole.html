Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Ripe Avocado, 2 large
        - Red Onion, 1/2, very small dice
        - Red Chilli, 1 large, deseeded and diced very small
        - Fresh Lime Juice, 1 1/2 tbsp
        - Tomato, 1 medium, very small dice
        - Coriander, 30 g (good bunch), finely chopped
        - Salt, 1/5 tsp

Method:
    - Prepare all ingredients apart from the avocado, placing them in a large bowl.
    - To get the most out of your Avocado:
        - Cut it in half parallel to the length of the avocado (bringing your knife in a circle around the stone). Then twist the two halves. This will split the avocado in half, one side left with the stone.
        - Twist the stone to remove. I do this by driving the blade of a chefs knife into the stone (it's relatively soft), then twisting.
        - For each half, make legthways cuts through the flesh, without going through the skin.
        - Extract the slices using a spoon to follow inside the skin of the avocado.
    - Add avocado to the bowl and without delay begin mashing with a sturdy fork or gently with a potato masher. You want to get the lime juice in contact with the avocado as quickly as possible, otherwise it'll brown.
    - Give it a good stir then transfer to a serving dish

Tips:
    - Guacamole is something that isn't worth making in advance, it tuns brown within an hour so.
    - More lime juice will slow the browning, but can make the guacamole too tangy.
