Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Waxy New Potatoes, 700 g, halved lengthways
        - Chorizo, 200 g, diagonally sliced
        - Garlic, 3 large cloves (22 g), sliced 1 mm thick
        - Onions, 2 medium, roughly sliced
        - Rosemary, 4 sprigs leaves (2 tbsp), leaves only, roughly chopped
        - Olive Oil, 1 tbsp
        - Ground Black Pepper, 1 tsp

Method:
    - Boil the new potatoes until slightly undercooked in well salted water.
    - Drain and set aside to cool completely.
    - In a large frying pan over a medium high heat, add the olive oil, chorizo and onions. Fry for a couple of minutes until the chorizo starts to release some of its oil.
    - Add the potatoes, garlic, rosemary and pepper. Sauté for about 10 minutes until the potatoes become golden stirring gently and often. Regulate the heat to ensure the garlic doesn't burn.
    - Serve with chopped rosemary over the top.
