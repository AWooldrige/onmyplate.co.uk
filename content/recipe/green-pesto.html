Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Fresh Basil, 90 g (large bunch)
        - Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 200 ml
        - Fresh Grated Parmesan, 50 g
        - Pine Nuts, 40 g, Lightly Toasted
        - Garlic, 1 large clove, crushed
        - Clear Honey, 1/2 tsp
        - Salt, 1/4 tsp
        - Ground Black Pepper, 1/2 tsp

Method:
    - Toast the pine nuts:
        - Heat a large, heavy base frying pan up to a medium heat.
        - Add the pine nuts to the pan, no oil, just dry.
        - Keep them moving until lightly brown. Don't be tempted to take them any further, it doesn't improve the pesto.
        - Leave to cool
    - Add all the ingredients to the food processor, wizz on low until it reaches the consistency you desire. Chunky or smooth, you choose.
    - Add more salt/honey if required. Do it slowly, you can quickly overdo it.
    - Refrigerate until needed, covered with clingfilm.
