Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Loose Leaf Assam Tea, 2 tsp
        - Whole Milk, 350 ml
        - Water, 350 ml
        - Brown Sugar, 4 tsp
        - Green Cardamom Pods, 10, split open slightly
        - Cinnamon Sticks, 1 large
        - Whole Black Peppercorns, 8
        - Cloves, 3
        - Ginger, 10 g (small chunk), peeled, thinly sliced
        - Whole Star Anise, 1
        - Whole Nutmeg, 1/2

Method:
    - Place a medium saucepan onto a high heat.
    - Add all of the spices to the pan along with the water. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and let simmer for 10 minutes.
    - Add the Assam tea and simmer for 1 minute.
    - Add the milk and sugar. It's best to add half the sugar now and then add more at the end if needed.
    - Turn up the temperature, keep stirring and turn down the heat immediately as it starts to boil. Simmer for 2 minutes.
    - Filter the spices out:
        - Remove the large cinnamon sticks from the pan (keep these aside, they look great placed inside the mugs)
        - Use any method you have handy to filter the spices out. I used a drip coffee filter paper and cone. Alternatively pour through a tea strainer or fine sieve.
    - Serve with the cinammon sticks placed in the mug.

Tips:
    - The base spice in masala chai is usually cardamom. As long as you always have that, you can pick and choose what spices you add to complement it.
    - If you don't boil the milk the drink is thought of as "raw". Although Assam can withstand this, I would break tradition and not boil if using a delicate tea such as Darjeeling. Instead gently heat for a minute.
    - I've used a few non-traditional spices such as star anise and ginger. Don't be afraid to experiment!
