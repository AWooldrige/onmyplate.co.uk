Prep Time: PT10M - 10 minutes
Yield: 6 portions as a side
Cuisine: British
Category: Side Dish, Salad

Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Waxy New Potatoes, 1 kg, bite-sized pieces
        - Light Hellman's Mayonnaise, 1 1/2 cups
        - Yellow Onion, 1/2 small (65 g), very finely diced
        - Capers, about 80 (5 tsp / 15 g), roughly chopped
        - Wholegrain Mustard, 1 tbsp
        - Fresh Dill, 10 g, roughly chopped
        - Pepper, 1 tsp
        - Olive Oil, 1/4 cup
        - White Wine Vinegar, 6 tsp
        - Clear Honey, 3 tsp
        - Salt, 1 tbsp

Method:
    - Prepare the potatoes:
        - Place new potatoes in a large saucepan with the salt. Cover with boiling water.
        - Boil until tender (or slightly before tender if you like it that way).
        - When ready, drain and run under cold water until the potatoes have cooled.
    - Whilst the potatoes are cooking, prepare the dressing in a large bowl by adding all the remaining ingredients and mixing well.
    - Taste the sauce for acidity and sweetness, adding more vinegar or honey as required.
    - Combine the cooled potatoes and the sauce in the large bowl. Serve.

Tips:
    - Add a tablespoon of oil to the potato water to reduce the chance of them boiling over.
    - "The best new potatoes for this recipe include any waxy potato: Jersey Royals, Charlotte, Maris Peer etc."
    - Make this salad up to 24 hours in advance and keep refridgerated until serving.
