Ingredients:
    Curry:
        - Chicken Breast, 1, sliced
        - King Prawns, 20, peeled
        - Pak Choi, 1 medium, not Thai - but very tasty
        - Baby Corn, 8, halved lengthways
        - Coconut Milk, 1 can
        - Thai Fish Sauce, 3 tbsp, or more to taste
        - Kaffir Lime Leaves, 4
        - Peanut Oil, 2 tbsp
        - Coriander, 30g bunch, roughly chopped
        - Unsalted Raw Cashew Nuts, 1 cup
        - Bamboo Shoots, 1 cup, lengthways matchsticks
    Thai Red Curry Paste:
        - Fresh Lemon Grass, 2 stalks, outer leaves removed and chopped
        - Dried Kaffir Lime Leaves, 2
        - Thai Fish Sauce, 3 tbsp
        - Light Soy Sauce, 1 tbsp
        - Brown Sugar, 2 tbsp
        - Salt, 1 tsp
        - Limes, 2, juiced
        - White Pepper, 1 tsp
        - Red Chilli, 2, deseeded
        - Ginger, thumb size piece, peeled
        - Garlic, 2 medium cloves, peeled
        - Shallots, 2, peeled and halved
        - Ground Cumin, 1 tsp
        - Ground Coriander, 1 tsp
        - Shrimp Paste, 1 1/2 tsp

Method:
    - Make the red curry paste by placing all the Thai Red Curry Paste ingredients into a food processor. Process on full speed for 60 seconds.
    - Prepare all ingredients, it will make it much easier to have everything ready:
        - Chicken sliced and King Prawns peeled (if necessary)
        - Baby corn quartered parallel to the length.
        - Bamboo shoots chopped parallel to the length
        - Trim the base of the pak choi, seperate leaves and half parallel to the length
    - Get your rice on. The rice should be cooked and just be keeping warm when you start cooking your curry.
    - Put a large pan on a high heat, add the peanut oil, chicken and red curry paste. Fry this for a few minutes until the chicken is half cooked.
    - Add the babycorn, fry for 30 seconds or so, to heat through.
    - Add the rest of the ingredients except the cashew nuts. Let everything bubble away for a few minutes until the baby corn is just tender and the prawns/chicken are cooked through.
    - At this point, it is very important to check the balance of flavours in the curry. Taste and check for a good balance of Savoury, Sweet, Sour and Salty. Adjust any of these by adding more fish sauce, sugar, lime juice or salt. This stage can make or break a curry. I usually find myself adding more of all of these.
    - Stir through the cashew nuts and chopped coriander just before serving.
    - Serve the rice moulded on a plate (I use an oiled mug to do this), and the curry in a separate dish. Add chopped coriander generously to garnish the curry and rice.
