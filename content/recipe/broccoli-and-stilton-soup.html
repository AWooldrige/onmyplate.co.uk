Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Brocolli,  1 large head (and stalk), roughly chopped
        - Stilton Cheese, 220 g, crumbled
        - Potato, 1 medium, peeled, medium dice
        - White onion, 1 medium, medium dice
        - Knorr Vegetable stock cubes, 2
        - Boiling Water, 800 ml
        - Double Cream, 2 tbsp
        - Unsalted Butter, 15 g
        - Light Soy Sauce, 2 tsp
        - Ground Black Pepper, 2 tbsp
        - Salt, to taste

Method:
    - Fry the onion in butter over a medium heat until just starting to turn golden.
    - Add the potato, water and stock cubes. Gently boil until the potatoes are tender.
    - Add the broccoli and stalks to the pan. Gently boil for another 5-7 mins.
    - Add all other ingredients to the pan, then transfer to a blender and blend to make a thick soup. Alternatively use a stick blender within the pan itself.
    - Check consistancy and add water if too thick.
    - Cool quickly if storing, or reheat and serve with crumbled stilton and a drop of cream to eat straight away.

Tips:
    - To prepare the stalks of the broccoli, cut off the outer husk (skin), and trim the dry end off. Medium dice and cook along with the chopped head.
    - It's always best to start with too little boiling water than too much. Its easier to thin down a soup at the end than it is to thicken it up.
