Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Cooked Butter Beans, 250 g
        - Cooked Cannellini Beans, 250 g
        - Cherry Tomatoes, 15, halved
        - Parsley, 35 g
        - Shallot, 35 g (1 large), quartered
        - Olive Oil, 2 tbsp
        - White Wine Vinegar, 2 tbsp
        - Sea Salt, 1/2 tsp

Method:
    - Make the green purée:
        - Place all ingredients except the butter beans and cherry tomatoes into a food processor.
        - Process on full speed for a few minutes. It takes a little while for the purée to turn the fresh green colour you're looking for.
        - Taste and adjust salt/vinegar levels.
    - Place the purée into a large bowl, then gently stir through the butter beans and halved cherry tomatoes.
    - Chill for at least an hour before serving.

Tips:
    - You can use canned beans, which are already cooked. I used 250 g in the ingredients list because a drained and rinsed 400 g can is about 250 g of beans. Cooking them from dried yields a far superior taste and texture, so if you have time give it a try. It also saves you from a dose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A#Health_effects" title="Bisphenol A Health Effects" target="_blank">Bisphenol A</a>.

<p>I came up with this recipe by reverse engineering a Butter Bean, Cherry Tomato & Parsley Healthpot from <a href="http://www.crussh.com/menu/healthpots" title="Crussh - Fit Food & Juice Bars" target="_blank">Crussh</a>. The creamyness of this salad is really surprising considering how low in fat it is.</p>
