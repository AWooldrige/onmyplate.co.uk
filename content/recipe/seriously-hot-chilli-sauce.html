Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Dried Naga Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), 4, left whole
        - Fresh Scotch Bonnet Chillies, 8, halved
        - Fresh Tomatoes, 3 medium (370 g), roughly diced
        - Tomato Purée, 3 tbsp
        - Yellow Onion, 2 medium (220 g), roughly diced
        - Garlic, 6 large cloves (35 g), roughly sliced
        - Smoked Paprika, 2 tsp
        - White Wine Vinegar, 8 tbsp
        - Vegetable Oil, 1 tbsp
        - Water, 2 tbsp
        - Sugar, 1 tsp
        - Salt, 1/2 tsp

Method:
    - In a saucepan (non-stick helps here), add the vegetable oil, onions, scotch bonnets and garlic. Place over a low heat and fry for ~10 minutes until lightly browned.
    - Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, smoked paprika and water to the pan. Stirring regularly, cook down with a lid on for ~25 minutes until the tomatoes have broken down.
    - Whilst the tomatoes are cooking down, rehydrate the chillies. Using tongs, very add the chillies to a of bowl of recently boiled water. Cover the bowl. Turn them halfway through to make sure all sides rehydrate.
    - When the tomato mixture has cooked, transfer it to a blender. Add the vinegar, salt and sugar to the blender also.
    - Using tongs, hold each chilli over the bowl. Use scissors to carefully snip the stalk off and discard it. Then place the chillies in the blender.
    - Blend for 1 minute to achieve a smooth sauce. Do this with a window open, and using a trustworthy blender with a securely fitting lid. This isn't the kind of sauce you want uncontrollably sprayed on you or your kitchen!
    - Taste for salt, sugar and vinegar levels, then allow to cool and serve.
