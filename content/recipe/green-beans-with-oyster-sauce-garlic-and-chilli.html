    Main:
        - Green Beans, 200 g
        - Peanut Oil, 1 tbsp
        - Garlic, 3 large cloves, sliced thin
        - Red Chilli, 1 large, sliced thin diagonally
        - Oyster Sauce, 2 tbsp
        - Salt, small pinch

Method:
    - Place a wok on a high heat. When up to temperature, add the peanut oil and wait until almost smoking.
    - Add the green beans and stir fry for 2 minutes until they just begin to brown.
    - Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic and chilli.
    - Stir fry until the garlic begins to brown slightly, as soon as it does add the oyster sauce and salt. 
    - Continue to cook for about a minute to allow the sauce to thicken up slightly.

Tips:
    - De-seed the chilli if you're looking for less heat.
