Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Whole Dried Red Chilli's, 5, dependant on the heat
        - Garlic, 3 cloves
        - Roasted Red Peppers, 2, cooled
        - White Wine Vinegar, 1 tbsp
        - Dried Cumin Seeds, 1 tsp, ground
        - Dried Coriander Seeds, 1 tsp, ground
        - Olive Oil, 3 tbsp
        - Salt, 1/2 tsp

Method:
    - Roast the red peppers (or use jarred red peppers if you don't have any fresh). Meanwhile soak the red chilli's in a covered bowl with some boiling water for 30 minutes.
    - Grind the coriander and cumin in a pestle and mortar
    - Place all the ingredients in a food processor, blend well adding olive oil to thin down the paste. Taste and add more salt or white wine vinegar if required to balance the flavours.
    - Chill before serving

Tips:
    - If using a mild dried chilli, you don't need to add the roasted red peppers, just use lots more chillies.
    - If you're using chilies that could kill a man (as with those I had in the cupboard), add the roasted red peppers to tame the sauce.
