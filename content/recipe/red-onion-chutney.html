Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Red Onions, 32 medium, sliced thin
        - Balsamic Vinegar, 800 ml
        - Red Wine Vinegar, 400 ml
        - Dark Brown Sugar, 880 g
        - Cinnamon Sticks, 28 cm worth
        - Freah Rosemary, 4 sprigs
        - Dried Bay Leaves, 8
        - Sunflower Oil, 4 tbsp

Method:
    - In a very large stockpot add the oil, rosemary, bay leaves and cinnamon. Place over a low heat for 15 mins to infuse the oil, gently stirring every so often.
    - Remove the rosemary and bay leaves with tongs, gently squeezing on the inside of the pan to make sure most of the oil stays in the pan.
    - Add the onions to the cinnamon and oil. Gently cook for about 30 mins, you're looking to evaporate the majority of the liquid from the onions so they're very soft.
    - Remove the cinnamon sticks
    - Add all of the other ingredients to the pan, raise the heat, continually stir and bring to simmer, then reduce the heat to low.
    - Let this reduce down slowly for about an hour, stirring often. It's ready when the thickness reaches that of loose chutney. Remember it will thicken up when it cools.
    - Transfer into <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Sterilize-Bottles-and-Jars-for-Preserves" title="How to Sterilize Bottles and Jars for Preserves" target="_blank">sterilised jars</a> and allow to cool.
    - Store in a cool, dark and dry place for at least a month to allow the flavours to settle.
