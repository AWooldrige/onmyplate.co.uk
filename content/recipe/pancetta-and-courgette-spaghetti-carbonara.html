Summary: As much as I love spaghetti carbonara, the lack of vegetables always makes it seem too heavy. Add a green element by including courgette when frying the pancetta.

Ingredients:
    Main:
        - Courgette, 1, deseeded, cubed
        - Pancetta, 130g, diced
        - Onion, 1 medium, finely diced
        - Spaghetti, 120 g (dry weight)
        - Garlic, 3 fat cloves, minced
    Sauce:
        - Eggs, 3, 2 full, 1 just yolk
        - Double Cream, 3 tbsp
        - Parmesan, 2 cups, grated
        - Black Pepper, 1 tsp
        - Lemon Juice, 1 tbsp
Method:
    - Prepare ingredients:
        - Mince the garlic, and store in a little pot mixed with some olive oil to prevent it drying out.
        - Wash and chop the courgette. Halve lengthways and use a teaspoon to scoop out the seeds in the middle (reduces the water content).
        - Prepare the sauce by combining all sauce ingredients together in a bowl (except the lemon juice).
    - Place a large pan of well salted water onto a high heat. Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti.
    - About 3 minutes after the spaghetti entered the water, begin frying the pancetta, courgette and onion over a high heat, in a good glug of olive oil.
    - Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve a cup of the cooking water then drain the spaghetti.
    - Add the fried ingredients and the sauce mixture to the saucepan of spaghetti. Stir well over a low heat, until just before the eggs start to firm.
    - Add the lemon juice then serve by twisting the spaghetti using tongs onto a plate (to get some centre height to the dish). Top with a wedge of lemon and some parsley.
